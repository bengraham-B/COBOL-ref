IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.                                    
PROGRAM-ID. HELLO.

    DISPLAY "Hello Cobol!".
STOP RUN.

### II. Loops
```
PERFORM UNTIL NOT ANumber
        EVALUATE true
            WHEN IsPrime DISPLAY " --- PRIME NUMBER ---" 
            WHEN IsOdd DISPLAY " --- ODD NUMBER ---" 
            WHEN IsEven DISPLAY " --- EVEN NUMBER ---" 
            WHEN LessThan5 DISPLAY " --- Less Then Five  ---" 
            WHEN OTHER DISPLAY "Default Action"
        END-EVALUATE
        ACCEPT TestNumber
END-PERFORM
```

### II. If - Else
